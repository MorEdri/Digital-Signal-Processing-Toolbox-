DSP Toolbox in Python
This project is a Python-based toolbox for generating, analyzing, and processing digital signals. It is designed to be user-friendly and modular, catering to both educational and practical applications in Digital Signal Processing.

Key Features:

Signal Generation: Generate sine, cosine, square, and triangular waveforms with customizable amplitude, frequency, and phase.
Filtering: Apply various filters (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop) to signals with adjustable parameters and visualized frequency responses.
FFT and IFFT Analysis: Perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze frequency components and inverse FFT for signal reconstruction.
Noise Addition: Introduce white, pink, or brown noise to signals and scale it to a desired Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
Visualization: Display time-domain and frequency-domain results using Matplotlib for effective analysis.
This toolbox is ideal for signal processing enthusiasts and professionals seeking a flexible tool for experimentation and learning.
